# DealWatch Repo-Side Closeout

## Purpose

This ledger records what the rebuilt canonical repository proves after the April 6 hard-cut.

In plain English:

- the public canonical repo was rebuilt onto a clean linear history
- the old canonical repo is no longer the public source of truth, no online archive repo remains, and the temporary local hard-cut backups were deleted after verification
- this file only talks about **repo-owned truth**
- live Render status still belongs to the separate live-truth ledger

Use the dated overlay when you need the full split between archive truth, rebuilt repo truth, GitHub remote truth, and remaining external blockers:

## Current Repo-Side Verdict

> **Repo-side verdict:** the canonical public repo now lives on a clean `main` with `<= 8` commits, no merge commits, no review-churn noise, current governance gates re-landed, and a single reissued canonical public release `v0.1.2`.

That is the honest call because:

- the rebuilt repo preserves the current product tree while discarding process-noise history
- the rebuilt repo keeps the current public entry `xiaojiou176-open/dealwatch`
- the old public repo was retired and the temporary archive repo plus local hard-cut backups were deleted after verification
- repo-owned governance gates, hook install path, and closeout ledgers were re-landed on the clean history

## Current Repo-Side Snapshot

| Field | Current value |
| --- | --- |
| Canonical repo | `xiaojiou176-open/dealwatch` |
| Default branch | `main` |
| Clean-history commit count target | `<= 8` |
| Current public release set | `v0.1.2` only |
| Old repo role | no live repo-owned archive remains; truth is preserved in the dated closeout ledgers |
| Open PRs | `0` |
| Open issues | `0` |
| Open Dependabot alerts | `0` |
| Open code-scanning alerts | `0` |
| Open secret-scanning alerts | `0` |

## Rebuilt History Shape

The canonical public history is intentionally reduced to these 8 semantic commits:

1. `feat(core): establish compare-first runtime foundation`
2. `feat(public): publish the static frontdoor and proof surfaces`
3. `feat(builder): add read-only builder distribution surfaces`
4. `chore(governance): add repository guardrails and operator verifiers`
5. `fix(security): scrub host paths and tighten publish hygiene`
6. `fix(governance): add final security and workflow gates`
7. `chore(hooks): add tracked pre-push and install path`
8. `docs(closeout): sync repo-side, live truth, and dated hard-cut overlay`

This history must stay free of:

- merge commits
- `sign off` / `review-fix` / PR-tip noise
- old repo identity drift
- stale closeout SHA / PR narratives

## P0 GitHub Configuration Re-landed

- branch protection on `main`
- Discussions enabled
- GitHub Pages configured for workflow publishing
- labels cloned back onto the rebuilt repo
- topics restored
- secret scanning and push protection enabled
- private vulnerability reporting enabled
- current gate set restored:
  - `test`
  - `frontend`
  - `governance`
  - `product-smoke`
  - `CodeQL`
  - `secret-hygiene`
  - `Dependency Review`
  - `workflow-hygiene`
  - `trivy`

## Release Surface Contract

The rebuilt canonical repo intentionally exposes only one public release:

- `v0.1.2`

Why:

- the older public tags `v0.1.0` and `v0.1.1` previously pointed at the same non-main orphan commit
- carrying those forward would re-pollute the rebuilt public release story
- the rebuilt public repo therefore reissues `v0.1.2` as the only canonical public release

The earlier release objects and legacy tag story are no longer kept as repo-owned rollback assets. Their existence is now preserved only by the dated closeout ledgers and the external platform residue those ledgers describe.

## Remaining Repo-Side vs External Split

- **repo-side engineering:** closed
- **Git/GitHub closure:** closed on the current canonical repo and GitHub surface
- **external blockers:** Render endpoints, GitHub social preview UI selection, and the unresolved PyPI package ownership/removal path remain outside repo-owned control
