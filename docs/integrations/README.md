# DealWatch Builder Integrations

## Purpose

This directory is the repo-native builder starter pack for DealWatch.

In plain English:

- the API, MCP, and CLI doors already exist
- this pack tells developers and agent-builders which door to use first
- it gives local-first examples without pretending DealWatch is already an SDK or hosted builder platform
- it includes a client config recipe ledger so wrapper honesty is part of the contract instead of tribal knowledge

Use this directory when the question is:

> "I am wiring Claude Code, Codex, OpenHands, OpenCode, OpenClaw, or a similar client to DealWatch. Where do I start, what is safe, and what should I not assume yet?"

## What this pack is

- a local-first onboarding pack
- a read-only-first builder pack
- a practical companion to [`../roadmaps/dealwatch-api-mcp-substrate-phase1.md`](../roadmaps/dealwatch-api-mcp-substrate-phase1.md)
- a place for concrete request and response shapes, starter prompts, config recipes, skill cards, and a repo-owned MCP inventory snapshot

## What this pack is not

- not an SDK release
- not a hosted multi-tenant control plane guide
- not a write-side automation guide
- not a promise that every route visible in `/openapi.json` is safe to market as stable builder surface

## Stable launch contract

Use these commands as the stable local-first launch contract:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m dealwatch --help
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m dealwatch builder-starter-pack --json
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m dealwatch builder-client-config codex --json
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m dealwatch builder-client-config --all --json
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m dealwatch server
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m dealwatch worker
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m dealwatch.mcp list-tools --json
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m dealwatch.mcp client-starters --json
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m dealwatch.mcp client-config --client codex --json
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m dealwatch.mcp client-config --all --json
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m dealwatch.mcp serve --transport stdio
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m dealwatch.mcp serve --transport streamable-http
```

These commands mean:

- the root CLI help now separates runtime, builder discovery, operator-only maintainer, and legacy bridge paths
- the builder-facing CLI discovery banner is reachable through a normal help path
- the root CLI can print the builder contract directly as JSON
- the root CLI can also print one copyable client config export directly as JSON
- the root CLI can also print the full all-clients config bundle directly as JSON
- the current wrapper-status ledger now treats OpenHands, OpenCode, and OpenClaw as `official_wrapper_documented` because their official docs publish concrete local config shapes, not just high-level MCP mentions
- the HTTP server is up
- the local worker can be brought up when you want the full runtime loop
- the shipped MCP tool registry is inspectable, including safe-first order, categories, and argument hints
- the shipped client starter registry is inspectable, including OpenClaw and skill-card anchors
- the MCP CLI can also print one client-specific config export directly as JSON
- the MCP CLI can also print the all-clients config bundle directly as JSON
- the builder starter pack is inspectable through a repo-owned read surface
- the MCP server can be handed to local stdio-capable clients
- the MCP server can also be exposed through streamable HTTP for clients such as Codex that document a URL-based MCP path

## Builder quick path

If you are new, do this in order instead of wandering through the repo:

1. read [`../roadmaps/dealwatch-api-mcp-substrate-phase1.md`](../roadmaps/dealwatch-api-mcp-substrate-phase1.md)
2. run `PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m dealwatch --help`
3. run `PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m dealwatch builder-starter-pack --json`
4. run `PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m dealwatch.mcp list-tools --json`
5. run `PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m dealwatch.mcp client-starters --json`
6. run `PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m dealwatch builder-client-config codex --json`
7. run `PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m dealwatch builder-client-config --all --json`
8. inspect `GET /api/runtime/builder-starter-pack`
9. inspect `GET /api/runtime/builder-client-config/codex`
10. inspect `GET /api/runtime/builder-client-configs`
11. open [`./config-recipes.md`](./config-recipes.md) when you need client-by-client wrapper status
12. open [`./examples/README.md`](./examples/README.md)
13. open [`./skills/README.md`](./skills/README.md) if you want copyable client rule cards
14. choose one first loop:
   - HTTP-first: `GET /api/runtime/readiness` -> `GET /api/runtime/builder-starter-pack` -> `POST /api/compare/preview`
   - MCP-first: `get_runtime_readiness` -> `get_builder_starter_pack` -> `compare_preview`

That order matters.

In plain English:

- first learn the building map
- then read the door labels
- then copy a small example, exported client config, client-specific starter, config recipe, or skill card
- only then start the actual runtime conversation

## First read path

If you are new, do not start by trying to mutate the runtime.

### HTTP-first

1. `GET /api/health`
2. `GET /api/runtime/readiness`
3. `GET /api/runtime/builder-starter-pack`
4. `GET /api/runtime/builder-client-config/{client}`
5. `POST /api/compare/preview`
6. `GET /api/watch-tasks` or `GET /api/watch-groups`
7. `GET /api/recovery-inbox`
8. `GET /api/settings/notifications`
9. `GET /api/settings/store-onboarding-cockpit`

### MCP-first

1. inspect `list-tools --json`
2. `get_runtime_readiness`
3. `get_builder_starter_pack`
4. `get_builder_client_config`
5. `compare_preview`
6. `list_watch_tasks` or `list_watch_groups`
7. one detail read
8. `get_recovery_inbox`
9. `get_notification_settings` or `get_store_onboarding_cockpit`

The safe mental model is:

> check the workshop is open, read the builder contract, preview compare truth, then read what is already there

## Stable now vs deferred vs internal-only

| Tier | What belongs here now | What stays out |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stable now | read-only MCP tools, health/readiness/recovery/notification/store reads, builder starter pack reads, compare preview, watch/group detail reads | write-side MCP, durable mutation as a builder default |
| Deferred | compare evidence artifact lifecycle, run-due automation, broader write-safe builder workflows | pretending every discovered route is already part of the front door |
| Internal-only | maintenance, owner bootstrap, provider webhook internals, legacy bridge paths, maintainer-only browser debug commands (`probe-live`, `diagnose-live`, `support-bundle`) | marketing those paths as external builder APIs |

## Client quick starts

Exact client config syntax varies across releases.

The stable part is not always the surrounding JSON or TOML wrapper.
The stable part is:

- the local stdio MCP command
- the read-only tool inventory
- the first safe tool flow
- the repo-owned recipe ledger that marks whether wrapper syntax is officially documented here or still intentionally unfrozen
- the direct client-config export surfaces that let a builder copy the current repo-owned example without opening the file tree first
- the all-clients config bundle when one agent wants the whole starter surface in a single read

| Client | Best first move | Safe first flow | What not to assume |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | register the local stdio MCP command, then read the substrate doc | `get_runtime_readiness` -> `get_builder_starter_pack` -> `compare_preview` -> `list_watch_tasks` or `list_watch_groups` | no write-side MCP, no hosted remote control plane |
| Codex | point Codex at the local runtime plus the streamable-HTTP MCP contract | `get_runtime_readiness` -> `get_builder_starter_pack` -> `compare_preview` -> one detail read | no SDK, no multi-tenant auth story |
| OpenHands | keep the client in observation mode first | runtime readiness -> builder starter pack -> compare preview -> recovery or store cockpit reads | skill-registry candidate only, no plugin marketplace claim |
| OpenCode | treat DealWatch as a local product truth source, not as a hosted platform service | MCP discovery -> builder starter pack -> compare preview -> watch or group detail | ecosystem-listing candidate only, no first-party store claim |
| OpenClaw | treat DealWatch as a local compare-first truth backend or workflow shell dependency, not as a runtime base | `get_runtime_readiness` -> `get_builder_starter_pack` -> `compare_preview` -> watch or group reads -> recovery or store cockpit reads | ClawHub candidate only, no registry listing claim yet |

Use the recipe ledger when you need the next level of honesty:

- [`./config-recipes.md`](./config-recipes.md)
- [`./recipes/claude-code.md`](./recipes/claude-code.md)
- [`./recipes/codex.md`](./recipes/codex.md)
- [`./recipes/openhands.md`](./recipes/openhands.md)
- [`./recipes/opencode.md`](./recipes/opencode.md)
- [`./recipes/openclaw.md`](./recipes/openclaw.md)

Use the export surfaces when you want the next level of convenience:

- `PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m dealwatch builder-client-config codex --json`
- `PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m dealwatch builder-client-config --all --json`
- `GET /api/runtime/builder-client-config/codex`
- `GET /api/runtime/builder-client-configs`
- `get_builder_client_config`
- `list_builder_client_configs`

## Official distribution reality by client

This is the shortest honest matrix for what the official platform surface is, what DealWatch
ships in-repo today, and what we still must **not** claim.

| Client | Official public surface | Repo-owned artifact now | Honest status today |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | official marketplace + custom marketplaces | [`plugins/dealwatch-builder-pack/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`](../../plugins/dealwatch-builder-pack/.claude-plugin/plugin.json), [`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](../../.claude-plugin/marketplace.json) | marketplace-submission candidate, **not officially listed** |
| Codex | Plugin Directory + repo/personal marketplace | [`plugins/dealwatch-builder-pack/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`](../../plugins/dealwatch-builder-pack/.codex-plugin/plugin.json), [`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`](../../.agents/plugins/marketplace.json) | Plugin Directory candidate, **not officially listed** |
| OpenHands | global skill registry | [`./skills/openhands-readonly-builder-skill.md`](./skills/openhands-readonly-builder-skill.md) | skill-registry candidate, **not officially listed** |
| OpenCode | ecosystem listing | [`./recipes/opencode.md`](./recipes/opencode.md), [`./examples/opencode.jsonc`](./examples/opencode.jsonc) | ecosystem-listing candidate, **not officially listed** |
| OpenClaw | ClawHub public registry | [`./recipes/openclaw.md`](./recipes/openclaw.md), [`./skills/openclaw-readonly-builder-skill.md`](./skills/openclaw-readonly-builder-skill.md), compatible bundle assets under [`plugins/dealwatch-builder-pack/`](../../plugins/dealwatch-builder-pack/) | ClawHub candidate, **not officially listed** |

## Official MCP Registry reality

The protocol itself now also has an official public registry surface:

- official public surface: MCP Registry (preview)
- official docs:
  - `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/registry/about`
  - `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/registry/quickstart`
  - `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/registry/package-types`
  - `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/server-discovery`
- repo-owned DealWatch reality today:
  - the local read-only MCP server already exists
  - the Python package metadata now includes publish-oriented `readme`, `license`, `project.urls`, and console-script entrypoints in `pyproject.toml`
  - CI now also guards that package surface through `scripts/verify_package_publish_surface.py` plus an sdist/wheel build in the main `test` lane
  - the builder docs and bundle assets already describe the local-first launch path
- honest status today:
  - registry-prep capable
  - **not published in the official MCP Registry**
  - no public package or remote registry entry has been pushed from this repo yet

In plain English:

DealWatch already has the product side of the MCP story, but the registry side still needs an external publish surface.

That means the remaining stop line is not “write more local docs.”
It is:

- publish a public package or remote server artifact the MCP Registry can point at
- use the official registry submission flow
- complete any namespace / release / owner verification required by that publish surface

## Repo-owned builder pack, native bundle candidates, and listing-prep assets

DealWatch now ships a **repo-owned builder pack**, **native plugin bundle candidates where the
platform already supports them**, and **listing-prep assets** for the broader builder/public
frontdoor.

The honest current shape is still local-first:

- one repo-owned stdio MCP launch command
- one read-only tool inventory
- one repo-owned client starter registry plus a builder starter pack read surface
- one starter prompt file per named client
- one shared skill card plus client-specific skill cards
- one shared native bundle at [`../../plugins/dealwatch-builder-pack/`](../../plugins/dealwatch-builder-pack/) for Claude Code and Codex, plus repo marketplaces at [`../../.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](../../.claude-plugin/marketplace.json) and [`../../.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`](../../.agents/plugins/marketplace.json)
- one crawlable public frontdoor across `builders.html`, `llms.txt`, `feed.xml`, `sitemap.xml`, and the social preview asset

Not every client has a native package today:

- Claude Code and Codex now have repo-owned native bundle artifacts
- OpenHands remains a skill-registry candidate
- OpenCode remains an ecosystem-listing candidate
- OpenClaw remains a ClawHub / registry candidate backed by compatible bundle assets and repo-native docs

Those artifacts live in the repo as builder material, not in a marketplace as already published listings.

That is enough to make plugin packaging, listing-prep copy, and SEO frontdoor work real without pretending a published listing or hosted plugin ecosystem already exists.

## Boundary reminder

If your plan needs any of the following, you are already outside the current builder promise:

- write-side MCP
- generic remote-safe operator control
- owner bootstrap as a general auth path
- maintenance or cleanup as external builder APIs
- browser debug lane commands as external builder APIs
- webhook or provider-secret flows as generic client integration
- SDK packaging or hosted multi-tenant maturity claims
